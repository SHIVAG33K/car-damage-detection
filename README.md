# Automated Vehicle Damage Assessment Using CLIP

## Introduction
This project introduces a novel approach to automated vehicle damage assessment by leveraging the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model developed by OpenAI. CLIP is a state-of-the-art visual-language model that understands the intricate relationship between images and text through contrastive learning.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to fine-tune the CLIP model on a specially curated dataset. This dataset consists of images of damaged vehicles along with corresponding textual descriptions of the damage. The fine-tuned model aims to autonomously generate descriptive reports of vehicle damage based on the input images, thus facilitating an automated assessment process without the need for manual intervention.

## Dataset
The dataset, named **CarDD**, is the first public large-scale dataset designed for vision-based car damage detection and segmentation. It contains **4,000 high-resolution car damage images** with over **9,000 well-annotated instances** of six damage categories. This rich dataset ensures that the model learns a comprehensive representation of vehicle damage types and severities. https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2211.00945

## Model Fine-tuning
The CLIP model is fine-tuned using the CarDD dataset. During this process, the model learns to correlate specific damage types and severities with their corresponding visual representations. The fine-tuning is performed with the goal of maximizing the model's accuracy in generating damage reports.

## Usage
To use the fine-tuned CLIP model for damage assessment:
1. Input an image of the damaged vehicle into the model.
2. The model processes the image and outputs a detailed report describing the damage.

## Results
The fine-tuned CLIP model demonstrates a high level of accuracy in damage assessment, significantly reducing the time and effort required for manual damage reporting.

## Future Work
Future enhancements will focus on expanding the dataset to include a wider range of damage types and integrating the model into a user-friendly application for end-users.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank OpenAI for providing the powerful CLIP model that serves as the foundation for this project. Additionally, we acknowledge the creators of the CarDD dataset for their invaluable contribution to the field of car damage detection.
